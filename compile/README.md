# Compile

> Clustered Arduino compile server. Each worker connects to a Redis-based queue and can process submissions concurrently. It is powered by [Throng](https://www.npmjs.com/package/throng) and [Bull](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bull).

<br/>

## Setup

`compile` depends on other services and must be run with the rest of the application. See the project [development](../README.md#development) setup for instructions.
